# Testing

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as it's web testing framework. All tests can be found in the [tests](./tests) directory. It includes e2e tests, api tests and accesiibility tests.

## Getting started

We need to setup the test environment first by creating a .env file from the .env-example file.

## Run Tests

`npm run test`

Will run all tests. After running the tests, a report will be generated in the [test-results](./test-results) directory, and opened in your browser at [http://localhost:9323/](http://localhost:9323).
